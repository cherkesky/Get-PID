Can't find your Google Place ID? Get Any Google My Business / Google Places Place ID (PID) with this simple program.


## Details
Finding your Google Places ID (PID) can be difficult. Most instructions will tell you to simply search for your company's name on `https://developers.google.com/places/place-id`, but the process is often more complicated.

I came across this problem today after trying to add a link to Google Reviews for one of my acquaintances and have implented a solution for anyone struggling to find their PID. Download and run this simple interface to easily find your PID.



#### Technology Stack: 
- Python
- Selenium Web Driver
- Tkinker
- PyInstaller

## Running Locally

Good Luck!
